# My First Python Program

Ah, nostalgia! This little gem was my first-ever Python program from when I started my coding journey 4 years ago. Back then, I was just getting the hang of things, so **optimization** was a foreign concept to me. 

Fast forward a bit, and I decided to dust it off (yep, it's been sitting on my computer for a while), and give it a glow-up. I added some fancy stuff, like saving tasks to a text file, and also tweaked it to be a bit more... well, optimized. 

## What does it do?

- It’s a **to-do list app**!
- You can add, remove, and view tasks.
- Now, thanks to my recent efforts, it also **saves** your tasks to a text file! So if you're like me and tend to forget things, your tasks are safe!

## Why is this here?

Well, every coder’s got to start somewhere. This was mine. So, if you're in the mood to see the evolution of a Python newbie's first program, or you just want to check off some tasks, give it a go!
